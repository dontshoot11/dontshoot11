Hi! I'm Artem, web developer. 
I write vanilla js code, react, astro, svelte, develop node.j applications.
Pet projects are simple and functional, I create them, as a rule, for my needs:
- https://github.com/dontshoot11/serbian_days calculator of visa-free days in Serbia
- https://github.com/dontshoot11/reset.css finalized with a few useful, in my opinion, things, https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
- https://github.com/dontshoot11/AstroXSveltePagesGenerator - Static web pages generator based on Astro and Svelte with custom modifications
